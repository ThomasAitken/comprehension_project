"Drive Home" by Steven Wilson

Cold windowpane
A car upturned in the rain
Wait on in vain
Don't try to bear the blame
Deal with the pain
Dust down your wings again
You need to clear away
All the jetsam in your brain
And face the truth
Well love can make amends
But while the darkness always ends
You're still alone
So drive home
Pause without end
A moment in time suspends
How could she leave?
Release all your guilt and breathe
Give up your pain
Hold up your head again
You need to clear away
All the jetsam in your brain
And face the truth
Well love can make amends
While the darkness always ends
You're still alone
So drive home
Drive home
Drive home
Drive home
Drive home
Drive home
Drive home
Drive home
Drive home
(Drive home)

"Let Down" by Radiohead

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
When it comes it's so, so, disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down
Let down
Let down
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, falling
Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
